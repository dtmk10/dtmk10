Since i was a kid, i was passionate about being a biologist. Now, i'm currently making myself a **Bioinformatician**, you could say i'm really passionate about researching between larges amount of data and finding my way to the knowledge. My current medium term goal is to be able to work in the biotech field, more specifically in the **omic data analysis**, **computational biology** and **developing tools** for biotech buddies.

My current trajectory is in its beggining phase, i have a Bachelor's Degree in Biology and a Application Web Development certificate. Nonetheless, if you are looking for a analitical, curious and stubborn person, feel free to connect with me through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/d-maquieira/).

## Current Objectives

- Adquiring expertise in R and Python.
- I'm currently focused in making this a potential portfolio, since im not a Bioinformatician yet, i would need to show what i'm capable of somewhere.


### What's in here?

This is my personal repository where im uploading the projects that i'm making in my current master's degree, feel free to check them or even ask me at any time!
